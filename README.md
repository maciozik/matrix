# Topple Squares - A little logic game about squares.

## How to play?

The purpose of the game is to find the 3 right squares randomly activated among the 9 squares of the grid.

You have to select 3 different squares per attempt. The number of right squares found among the 3 squares you selected is displayed at the end of each attempt, but you will not know which of the 3 squares selected are right and which ones are wrong.

Once the 3 right squares are found, 3 new squares are randomly activated and a new round begins. You can do as many attempts as you want per round in order to find the 3 right squares, and as many rounds as you can within the time limit.
