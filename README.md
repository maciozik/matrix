# Matrix - A little logic game about boxes.

## How to play?

The purpose of the game is to find the 3 right boxes randomly activated among the 9 boxes of the grid.

You have to select 3 different boxes per attempt. The number of right boxes found among the 3 boxes you selected is displayed at the end of each attempt,but you will not know which of the 3 boxes selected are right and which ones are wrong.

Once the 3 right boxes are found, 3 new boxes are randomly activated and a new round begins. You can make as many attempts as you want per round in order to find the 3 right boxes, and as many rounds as you can within the time limit.

## Where can I play?
